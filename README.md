# ebac_mission_impossible_landing

***
In this project, it was necessary to choose any movie and use it as a theme for the creation of a landing page. As you can see below, the movie I chose was "Mission: Impossible 7" 
and, as inspiration, I used its official page, adding some very interesting elements like a background with a gradient color, a movie banner with an animation continuous, 
a "back to top" button, a form with a submit button released only when the user fills in the data, javascript to manage the behavior of the page and a responsive layout.
